"Though I don't work in the offices, I hear they're bodies whose kids haven't seen them in years or whose grandkids forgot their addresses or whose neighbors liked them enough to chit-chat close to their doors, but not enough to lend money for their headstones. A lot of 'em didn't have a regular doctor to sign the death certificate. They come to me rolled in plastic and tarp and bound with twine. They've hardened and shrunk no matter who and what they were when alive. They're featureless and faceless and nameless but numbered with a tag on the plastic, so we know which slot to put their cardboard box of ashes in down in the cool cellar. When it's been a year or two after the person was found but nobody's ever come to claim their ashes, we bury the ashes in a communal plot donated by the County and paid for with sales from the deceaseds' auctioned estates. I wear a fiber filtration mask for the dust and the ashes and the fumes. I wear paper booties and a jumpsuit for caution. I listen to WGCI when I'm working with a body and I watch WGN when I get a rest."
